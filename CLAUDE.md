# Alpha Signal v2 — AI Context

This file is short on purpose. Rules only. Reference lives in `docs/reference/`.

## The system (rule of 3 at every level)

**3 files in head:** `README.md` · `CLAUDE.md` · `HANDOFF.md`
**3 folders in head:** `docs/plans/` · `docs/decisions/` · `docs/reference/`
**3 sections in HANDOFF:** Left off · Pick up here · Watch out
**3 steps per session:** `/catchup` → work → `/handoff`

Everything else (memory, `_archive/`, slash commands, settings) — Claude handles.

## Critical Rules

**Environment**
- Activate venv first: `source ~/alpha-signal/venv/bin/activate` (shared with v1)
- v1 is LIVE on cron — never touch `~/alpha-signal/`. All v2 work in `~/alpha-signal-v2/`
- Credentials live in v1's `run_pipeline.sh` exports — never in code. v2 imports them at runtime via `eval "$(grep '^export ' /home/ubuntu/alpha-signal/run_pipeline.sh)"` (read-only, no execution of v1 body) — used by `run_pipeline.sh` and the v2 cron lines. Don't duplicate secrets anywhere.
- Any cron running `python -m <module>` MUST `cd /home/ubuntu/alpha-signal-v2 &&` first — cron's CWD is `$HOME`, so `-m` fails `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sources'` silently into a log no one reads. The monthly `analyst_consensus_snapshots` cron silently no-op'd this way until fixed 2026-06-03. When adding a cron, mirror the watchdog/health lines (they `cd` first).

**Architecture & Code**
- No frameworks, no base classes, no YAML. Plain functions, Python config dict, SQLite. See `docs/decisions/0004-no-base-classes-no-yaml.md`
- ETFs excluded — universe is 2,448 stocks, not 2,500
- `cap_tier` must be assigned before any ranking — never rank without segment
- Never rank across tiers — always within-segment
- Financial sector stocks route through the financial sub-model, not the main screener
- Tickertape SIDs ≠ NSE tickers (e.g. `REDY` not `DRRD`). Always use universe SIDs

**Data Operations**
- Never run two harvester scripts simultaneously — doubles request rate, risks IP block
- 2-second delay minimum between external API calls
- Smoke test with 3 stocks before any full run
- `INSERT OR IGNORE` for append-only tables (insider_trades, bulk_deals, news_articles)
- `INSERT OR REPLACE` for snapshot tables (analyst_consensus, regime_state, signal tables)
- Read `docs/reference/data-playbook.md` before fetching from any new source

**Health & observability**
- Daily health email at 04:00 UTC + URGENT push on CRITICAL. Driven by `tools/health_report.py` — one source of truth for terminal/email/push. `/catchup` runs it first; never skip its output.
- Silent failures are the enemy. Producers MUST raise on missing env or 0 output (not write placeholders). `freshness_watchdog` covers DB tables AND file outputs via `config.FILE_OUTPUTS`.
- Push: ntfy.sh — set `NTFY_TOPIC` env var in `~/alpha-signal/run_pipeline.sh` to enable phone push. Without it, URGENT email still fires on CRITICAL.

**LLM output hygiene**
- Narrative LLM fields (dossier thesis/bull/bear/catalysts/risks) MUST NOT contain raw numbers — they hallucinate plausibly. Numbers live ONLY in structured fields (`target_price`, `stop_loss`, etc.). `output/dossier.py` validates this; cockpit `get_dossier()` returns `{}` for invalid dossiers. See HALC 2026-05-22 ("16.5% downside at ₹1038" — 950/1038 = -8.5%).
- Calendar tokens (Q1, FY25, H1) are allowed. Specific decimals / percentages / rupee amounts / multiples / score ratios are not.

**Data-cadence rule (per HANDOFF 2026-05-22)**
- Analyst price targets are EPISODIC, not continuous. Sell-side analysts revise quarterly at best — most days the underlying PT is unchanged. Daily PT history is phantom precision and lets `lastPrice` masquerade as PT. The 2026-05-22 HALC bug lived in this gap.
- Three tables, three rhythms — keep them straight:
  - `analyst_consensus` (PK=sid, daily-refreshed): cockpit "current PT" view. Daily yfinance refresh updates `price_target` + `total_analysts` only; leaves Tickertape-sourced `forward_eps` / growth fields intact.
  - `analyst_consensus_snapshots` (PK=sid+date+source, MONTHLY): backtest + revision signals. Cron: 1st of month 04:30 UTC. NEVER write a daily row to this table.
  - `forecast_history` (year-end snapshots from Tickertape's `forecastsHistory.price`): ~1 row per stock per year (Dec 27-28). The `_extract_forecast_rows` fetcher filters out the contaminating "today" entry — anything dated within 90 days is treated as `lastPrice`, not a PT.
- When adding any new "PT-like" producer: ask first "is this episodic?". If yes, snapshot table at the natural cadence (monthly or quarterly), not daily.

**Backtest hygiene**
- Ship a factor module and its PIT helper as one unit — never separately
- Register every shipped factor in `BACKTEST_SIGNALS`; sub-|t|=1.5 ids also go in `FACTOR_LIBRARY`. See [ADR 0017](docs/decisions/0017-factor-library-two-tier-registry.md)
- Don't add to `SCREEN.weight_tiers` until t-stat ≥ 1.5 on at least one cap tier, and never mechanically — see `docs/reference/signal-weights.md`
- `reconstruct_pit.py` writes only the columns the requested signals produced — `--signal X` is safe on existing dates by construction. If you ever pad missing PIT_COLUMNS with NaN before the write, you'll wipe every untouched column on UPDATE — don't.

**Git**
- Never `git commit --amend`, `git add .`, `git add -A`
- Never `pkill -f "uvicorn cockpit.app"` — pattern matches prod systemd service

**Graph-first lookup**
- Before any cross-file grep/read sweep, query the graphify MCP first (`mcp__graphify__*`). The graph indexes 1,792 nodes / 2,801 edges at 90% extraction confidence — use it for navigation and recall, then read only the specific files it points to.
- Do NOT query the graph for files you're about to edit — read them directly. Graph is for finding things, not for the working file.
- Do NOT run `graphify --update` yet. Graph is frozen on the 2026-05-23 snapshot until Amit rebuilds without image extraction. Trial period: ~1 week from 2026-05-24, then revisit cadence.

## Session Protocol

**Start:** `/catchup` reads HANDOFF.md + `docs/plans/0000-checklist.md` + the active plan. Names the specific checklist item(s) this session will work on — if the goal isn't already a bullet, add it before starting.
**End:** `/handoff` overwrites HANDOFF.md, updates the checklist (step 1.5), files any ADRs, updates plan status, commits.

Skipping `/handoff` is the single biggest source of context loss. Working on something that isn't on the checklist is the second.

## When to write a doc

| Trigger | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| Non-obvious technical choice | New ADR in `docs/decisions/` (write-once, ≤30 lines) |
| Detail diverges from active plan | Append to that plan's "Implementation notes" |
| New recurring landmine | One-line rule in this file's Critical Rules |
| Plan reaches "Done when" | Status → implemented; reflect in `docs/reference/`; archive in 30 days |
| Plan checkbox ticked or scope changed | Tick the same item in `docs/plans/0000-checklist.md` |

If unsure where a doc goes: would I open this file again in 3 months? If no, skip.
